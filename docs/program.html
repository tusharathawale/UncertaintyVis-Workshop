    <dd><u>Title</u>: Uncertainty Visualization: The Importance of Quantification</dd>
    <dd><u>Bio</u>: Daniel Weiskopf is a professor and director of the Visualization Research Center (VISUS) at
the University of Stuttgart, Germany. He received his Dr. rer. nat. (PhD) degree in physics
from the University of Tübingen, Germany (2001), and the Habilitation degree in computer
science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany (2005). His research interests include
visualization, visual analytics, eye tracking, human-computer interaction, computer graphics,
augmented and virtual reality, and special and general relativity. He is spokesperson of the
DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center SFB/Transregio 161 “Quantitative Methods for
Visual Computing” (www.sfbtrr161.de), which covers basic research on visualization
including uncertainty visualization.</dd>

    <dd>Panelists: Dr. Han-Wei Shen, Dr. Matthew Kay, Dr. Lace Padilla, Dr. Gerik Scheuermann</dd>
    <dd>Han-Wei Shen is a Full Professor at The Ohio State University, and currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. He is a member of IEEE VGTC Visualization Academy, and was the chair of the steering committee for IEEE SciVis conference from 2018-2020. His primary research interests are scientific visualization and computer graphics. Professor Shen is a winner of National Science Foundation's CAREER award and US Department of Energy's Early Career Principal Investigator Award. He has served as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, a paper chair for IEEE Visualization, IEEE Pacific Visualization, and IEEE Parallel Visualization and Graphics. He is currently on the IEEE Visualization conference executive committee, and IEEE SciVis steering committee. He has published more than 50 papers in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics and IEEE Visualization conference, the very top journal and conference. He received his BS degree from Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University in 1988, 
	    the MS degree in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1992, and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Utah in 1998. From 1996 to 1999, he was a research scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View California.</dd>
    <dd>Matthew Kay is an Associate Professor jointly appointed in Computer Science and Communications Studies at Northwestern University. He works in human-computer interaction and information visualization, with a particular focus on uncertainty visualization, visualization literacy, and the design of human-centered tools for data analysis. His research has been funded by multiple NSF awards, and he has received multiple best paper awards across human-computer interaction and information visualization venues, including ACM CHI, IEEE VIS, and UbiComp. He also received the 2023 IEEE VGTC Significant New Researcher Award. He co-directs the Midwest Uncertainty Collective (https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/) and is the author of the tidybayes (https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/) and ggdist (https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/)
